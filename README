This project contains tools that can be useful when creating web content systems.

Currently the following modules are available:

se.softhouse.garden.orchid.commons
	This contains an extension to the MessageFormat available in the JDK.
	It provides functionality to used named arguments instead of numbered arguments.

	It also contains a text loader which can load messages from a directory structure.
	It uses the same structure as used by properties in java except that the key is
	the path to the file, i.e. the property key a.b.c.d maps to the file a/b/c/d.txt
	where the suffix might differ. The filename might also contain the locale name,
	e.g. d_en_US.txt. It is also possible to add property files in the structure,
	they are then interpreted and inserted in the hierarchy.

	the MessageSource beans to support the OrchidMessageFormat and
